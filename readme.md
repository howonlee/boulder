Demo for VRITS demo competition

Setup:
1.	Copy everything in the 'resources' folder into the 'resources' folder of Vizard.
2.	Follow the advice from the readme.txt in the Anim folder to copy out the animations. The animations alone are 300mb, so this is necessary.

Use the .dae (COLLADA) format for the boulder, which works awesomely.
