Copy over everything from the M High A3 animation folder here, then copy over to the resources folder.
also, copy out another copy of these seven files:
CC2_mHigh_m_dancing_neutral
CC2_mHigh_m_walk_neutral_01_inplace
CC2_mHigh_m_sit_table_idle_neutral_01
CC2_mHigh_m_sit_chair_idle_neutral_01
CC2_mHigh_m_run_neutral_01_inplace
CC2_mHigh_m_idle_neutral_01
CC2_mHigh_m_gestic_talk_neutral_01

and append _A0 to the filenames of each of them. (So, for example,
CC2_mHigh_m_dancing_neutral_A0.caf
)
That should be all the requirements.
